This is fairly weak documentation so far.  To build the
library, do:

	make

If that doesn't work, try:

	make compat

To build with debugging and the debugging programs, run:

	make debug

which uses bounds checking, or to use gdb:

	make gdb

Thats it.  If it doesn't work, I'm sorry.  Let me know; you
can reach me at ian@penguinhosting.net.

To use it, take a look at gui.c and firetalk.h.  Together,
these provide a pretty good idea of how to use the library.
